MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DISORDERS
F33.4 Recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission
Diagnostic guidelines
For a definite diagnosis:
(a) the criteria for recurrent depressive disorder (F33. -) should have
been fulfilled in the past, but the current state should not fulfil
the criteria for depressive episode of any degree of severity or
for any other disorder in F30-F39; and
(b) at least two episodes should have lasted a minimum of 2 weeks
and should have been separated by several months without
significant mood disturbance.
Otherwise the diagnosis should be other recurrent mood [affective]
disorder (F38.1).
This category can still be used if the patient is receiving treatment
to reduce the risk of further episodes.
F33.8 Other recurrent depressive disorders
F33.9 Recurrent depressive disorder, unspecified
Includes: monopolar depression NOS
|2£| Persistent mood [affective] disorders
These are persistent and usually fluctuating disorders of mood in
which individual episodes are rarely if ever sufficiently severe to
warrant being described as hypomanic or even mild depressive
episodes. Because they last for years at a time, and sometimes
for the greater part of the individual's adult life, they involve
considerable subjective distress and disability. In some instances,
however, recurrent or single episodes of manic disorder, or mild
or severe depressive disorder, may become superimposed on a
persistent affective disorder. The persistent affective disorders are
classified here rather than with the personality disorders because of
evidence from family studies that they are genetically related to the
mood disorders, and because they are sometimes amenable to the
same treatments as mood disorders. Both early- and late-onset varieties
of cyclothymia and dysthymia are described, and should be specified
as such if required.

Question: Give me the correct coded classification for the following diagnosis: Recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission

Solution: F33.4 Recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission.

Explanation:
The provided diagnosis is "Recurrent depressive disorder, currently in remission."

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for this diagnosis is F33.4.

This code is used for recurrent depressive disorder, which is a mood disorder characterized by recurrent depressive episodes, where the current state does not meet the criteria for any depressive episode or other disorder in F30-F39.

To arrive at this classification, the diagnostic guidelines provided in the ICD manual were followed. According to the guidelines, the diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder requires a history of recurrent depressive episodes. The current state should not meet the criteria for any depressive episode or other disorder in F30-F39.

In this case, the current state is in

Query: What are the diagnostic criteria for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?
Answer: Human: 
Answer the following question based only on the provided context.
Think step by step before providing a detailed answer.

F40-F48 NEUROTIC, STRESS-RELATED AND SOMATOFORM DISORDERS
without obvious autonomic arousal are also common. There is
a close relationship between obsessional symptoms, particularly
obsessional thoughts, and depression. Individuals with obsessive-
compulsive disorder often have depressive symptoms, and patients
suffering from recurrent depressive disorder (F33.-) may develop
obsessional thoughts during their episodes of depression. In either
situation, increases or decreases in the severity of the depressive
symptoms are generally accompanied by parallel changes in the
severity of the obsessional symptoms.
Obsessive - compulsive disorder is equally common in men and
women, and there are often prominent anankastic features in the
underlying personality. Onset is usually in childhood or early adult
life. The course is variable and more likely to be chronic in the absence
of significant depressive symptoms.
Diagnostic guidelines
For a definite diagnosis, obsessional symptoms or compulsive acts,
or both, must be present on most days for at least 2 successive
weeks and be a source of distress or interference with activities. The
obsessional symptoms should have the following characteristics:
(a) they must be recognized as the individual's own thoughts or
impulses;
(b) there must be at least one thought or act that is still resisted
unsuccessfully, even though others may be present which the
sufferer no longer resists;
(c) the thought of carrying out the act must not in itself be pleasurable
(simple relief of tension or anxiety is not regarded as pleasure
in this sense);
(d) the thoughts, images, or impulses must be unpleasantly repetitive.
Includes: anankastic neurosis
obsessional neurosis
obsessive - compulsive neurosis
Differential diagnosis. Differentiating between obsessive - compulsive
disorder and a depressive disorder may be difficult because these
two types of symptoms so frequently occur together. In an acute
episode of disorder, precedence should be given to the symptoms
that developed first; when both types are present but neither
predominates, it is usually best to regard the depression as primary.
